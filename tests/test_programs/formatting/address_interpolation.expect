=== Basic Variable Address Interpolation ===
Address of x: 0x7fff0008
Address of y: 0x7fff0018
Address of pi: 0x7fff0028
Address of flag: 0x7fff0038
Address of ch: 0x7fff0048

=== Hex Format Specifiers ===
x address (lowercase hex): 0x7fff0008
y address (uppercase hex): 0x7FFF0018

=== Pointer Variables ===
ptr_x points to: 0x7fff0008
ptr_y points to: 0x7fff0018
ptr_pi points to: 0x7fff0028

=== Mixed Interpolation ===
x=42 at address 0x7fff0008, ptr_x=0x7fff0008
y=100 at 0x7fff0018
pi=3.14159 at 0x7FFF0028

=== Multiple Variables in One Line ===
Variables: x=42, y=100, &x=0x7fff0008, &y=0x7fff0018
Pointers: ptr_x=0x7fff0008, ptr_y=0x7FFF0018
