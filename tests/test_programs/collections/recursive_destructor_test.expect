=== Recursive Destructor Verification ===
1. Creating Vector<TrackedObject>:
  objects.len() = 3
  Exiting scope - expect destructor calls:
  ~TrackedObject(100) called
  ~TrackedObject(200) called
  ~TrackedObject(300) called

2. If you see TrackedObject destructor calls above, recursive destruction works!
   If not, there's still a bug to fix.
