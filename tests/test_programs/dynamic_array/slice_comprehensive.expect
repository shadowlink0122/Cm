=== Slice Comprehensive Test ===

--- Primitive Types ---
int[]: 5 elements
ints[0] = 1, ints[4] = 5
float[]: 3 elements
bool[]: 3 elements
char[]: 5 elements
string[]: 3 elements
strings[0] = Hello

--- Struct Slice ---
Point[]: 2 elements
points[0].x = 1, points[0].y = 2
After push: 3 elements
points[2].x = 5

--- Slice as Struct Member ---
c.name = container1
c.values.len() = 3
c.values[0] = 100
c.values[1] = 200
c.values[2] = 300

--- Slice Methods ---
Empty: len=0, cap=4
After push x3: len=3
Popped: 30, len=2
After remove(0): len=1, arr[0]=20
After push x2: len=3
After clear: len=0

--- Array Literal Init ---
nums initialized with 5 elements
nums[0] = 10
nums[1] = 20
nums[2] = 30
nums[3] = 40
nums[4] = 50
