=== Nested Vector Lifecycle Test ===
1. Inner Vector<int> construction:
  inner1.len() = 2
2. Outer Vector<Vector<int>> construction:
  matrix.len() = 0 (empty)
3. Push inner to outer (with move):
  matrix.len() = 1
4. Access inner via get:
  row0.len() = 2
  row0: [1, 2]
5. Add second row:
  matrix.len() = 2
6. Access second row:
  row1.len() = 3
  row1: [10, 20, 30]
7. Consistency check:
  row0 again: [1, 2]
